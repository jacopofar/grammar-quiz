# grammar-quiz
Online cloze deletion tool focused on grammar

This is a project for the [Kodoeba event](https://blog.tatoeba.org/2020/05/announcing-kodoeba-1.html) organized
by Tatoeba.

This project aims at using the vast sentence database of Tatoeba to generate grammar exercises, in particular cloze
deletions, that can be used both to study and to evaluate the usage of a language.

This project will be completely FOSS and the produced data will be published when possible and non-personal
(e.g. user account data).
